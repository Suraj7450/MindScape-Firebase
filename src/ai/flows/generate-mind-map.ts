  Given a main topic, you will generate a comprehensive, multi - layered mind map.

  ${targetLang ? `The entire mind map, including all topics, categories, and descriptions, MUST be in the following language: ${targetLang}.` : 'The entire mind map MUST be in English.'}
  ${searchContextSection}

  The mind map must start with { and have the FOLLOWING JSON structure (MANDATORY):
{
  "mode": "single",
  "topic": "${topic}",
  "shortTitle": "(Generate a catchy, short title for the map. DO NOT include the words 'Mind Map')",
  "icon": "brain-circuit",
  "thought": "Deep reasoning about the entire topic structure...",
  "subTopics": [
    {
      "name": "Subtopic Name",
      "icon": "flag",
      "thought": "Reasoning about this branch...",
      "insight": "Wisdom about subtopic",
      "categories": [
        {
          "name": "Category Name",
          "icon": "folder",
          "thought": "Reasoning about this category...",
          "insight": "Wisdom about category",
          "subCategories": [
            {
              "name": "Subcategory Name",
              "description": "One sentence explanation.",

            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

  IMPORTANT RULES:
  - YOU MUST include "mode": "single" in the root object.
  - JSON field names MUST be EXACTLY: mode, topic, shortTitle, icon, thought, subTopics, categories, subCategories, name, description, insight.
  - The "thought" fields are for deep analysis and are CRITICAL for Deep Mode. Use them to plan the complexity of each branch.
  - Icons must be valid lucide-react names in kebab-case (e.g., "scroll", "landmark", "shield").
  - Sub-category descriptions MUST be exactly one sentence.
  - ${densityInstruction}
  - Ensure ALL JSON is properly closed.
  - DO NOT TRUNCATE. If you must stop, close all open [ and { structures.
  - PRIORITY: Depth and accuracy are more important than speed. Take your time to generate a full, rich dataset.
  ${searchContext ? '- Ground all information in the provided search results. Use current facts and recent developments.' : ''}
